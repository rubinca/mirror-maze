# mirror-maze
## [Interview Questions Solution]
Problem: There is a rectangular room with a laser, about to be fired at the rightmost wall. The room is represented by a 2D array, each square of which can be either nothing, a mirror (/\O), or a prism (^><v). Prisms reflect light in the direction the arrow is facing, mirrors bounce light in either a 90 degree (/\) or 180 degree (O) angle. Determine how many squares the lazer will travel before hitting a wall. Infinite loops MUST be detected within one loop.

Solution: write room description in data.txt. Run npm install. Run node mirror_maze_solver.js.
